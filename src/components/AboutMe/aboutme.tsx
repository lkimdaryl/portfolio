                Hello there! <strong>I'm Kim</strong>, an upcoming graduate at UCSD. I am <strong>passionate</strong> about <strong>software</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>. My 
                passion has grown since diving into courses like <strong>Web Client Languages</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong>. 
                At UCSD, I've had the chance to work with talented student-led teams, delving deep into <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> development.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm particularly excited about <strong>creating websites and applications that are easy for everyone to use</strong>. 
                Whether it's making a site look good on all devices or ensuring it works well for people with different 
                needs, I love finding <strong>solutions</strong> that make the web <strong>accessible</strong>. I also enjoy working with others to <strong>bring ideas to life</strong>, 
                combining creativity and technology to <strong>build something meaningful</strong>. 
                I'm eager to <strong>continue learning </strong> and <strong>growing</strong> in this field, making a <strong>positive impact</strong> along the way.
            </p>
